UIColor+FlatColors
==================

`UIColor+FlatColors` is a category that extends `UIColor` with methods to get the colors from the [Flat UI](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/) framework by [designmodo](http://designmodo.com/).

That's it.

I suggest you take a look at [FlatUIKit](https://github.com/Grouper/FlatUIKit) if you are looking for the full components of the Flat UI framework to use in your app.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

```ruby
platform :ios

pod 'UIColor+FlatColors'
```

### Paleolithic way

Drag and drop the files in the **UIColor+FlatColors** folder into your project.

## License

`UIColor+FlatColors` is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/mokagio/UIColor-FlatColors/blob/master/LICENSE).
