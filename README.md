PopPlayground
=============

Examples and Controls made entirely using Pop (Facebook's framework)

This project includes 3 different tabs:
  1) Basic concepts: comparison between iOS animations and new Pop's animations.
  2) Examples: Some examples animating many different properties using Pop
  3) Controls: two UIControls made entirely using Pop. The controls are unfinished (no callback functions, completion blocks, etc.), just animations
  
This code is complement for the following video. Please check it out.
